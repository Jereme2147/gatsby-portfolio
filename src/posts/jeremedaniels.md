### My second and previous portfolio page.

### What I'm proud of with this page:
###### This page is actually a single page site.  All of the content is technically all loaded initially.  With the use of jQuery and PHP it gives the feeling of a multiple page website that loads very quickly.  I've choosen to replace it because I find it more important to showcase new technologies that are more applicable to modern web development.
